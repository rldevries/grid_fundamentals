To use:
: open animate_transform.html (all code inside is provided for the CSS Style)
: CSS Style Sheet: although not standardized, the style_transfrom.css is used


Simply illustrates both animation and transform using:
: translateX()
: translateY()
: translateZ()

To cap it, used animate to provide a visual action on the items.

Future Considerations:
: clearly there's a better way to use the nth-child as this is not 'DRY'
